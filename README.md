## Overview
Welcome to the GNN-Malware Detector project! This tool is designed to efficiently detect malware using Graph Neural Networks (GNN). It simplifies the malware detection process, providing an easy-to-use script that automates the necessary steps.

## Quick Start
To initiate the process, execute the command `sudo ./gnn-malwaredetector.sh`. On its first run, the script will automatically create a virtual environment and proceed to install a series of essential packages. This ensures that all dependencies are properly isolated, maintaining the integrity of your system. Once the initial setup is complete, the script will handle all necessary configurations and initiate the malware detection process. The command sudo ./gnn-malwaredetector.sh is all you need to get the system operational. Please ensure that you execute the script with superuser privileges to allow for proper installation and functioning.

## Project Structure

This project includes a variety of directories and files, each with a specific purpose. Below is a description of each:

### Directories:

- `backupcsv/` - This directory contains backup CSV files, which are likely used to store data for recovery or analysis, as well as virtual machine (VM) environments.
- `gnn/` - Contains all the Graph Neural Network (GNN) related modules or scripts that are part of the malware detection system.
- `image/` - Stores image files for readme.

### Files:

- `gnn-malwaredetector.sh` - A shell script that sets up the environment and runs the malware detector.
- `gnn_scanner.py` - The Python script likely contains the logic for scanning with GNN algorithms and extracts the results into `predicted_ones_output.csv`.
- `network_packets.csv` - A CSV file that might contain data captured from network packets, used for analysis.
- `paquet_capture.py` - A Python script for capturing data from packets, which feeds into the `network_packets.csv` file.
- `predicted_ones_output.csv` - This CSV file likely contains the output from the GNN predictions, identifying potential malware.
- `requirements.txt` - Lists all the Python dependencies required by the project, which can be installed using `pip`.

# Dataset

The dataset used for training the Graph Neural Network is available [here](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset). This dataset is critical for understanding the patterns and anomalies in network traffic that are indicative of malware.

# Colaborative Environment

The collaborative environment for this project, which includes the development and testing notebooks, can be accessed [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QqXdpQABw4GQ_xUlPi2gRwDsM7NGcWht?authuser=4). This shared space is where the majority of the project's exploration and iterative development has taken place.
